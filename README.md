Implementation of Euclid's Algorithm for finding Greatest Common Divisor.

## What is
The Greatest Common Divisor, GCD, of two integers x and y that are both nonzero is the largest positive integer  
that is a factor of both x and y.  

GCD Theorem  
Let x and y be two positive integers.  Then  
GCD(x,y) = GCD(y mod x, x)
